This project represents VS Code Extension template of the language client, based on Xtext language server. Template is based on the [itemis/xtext-languageserver-example] (https://github.com/itemis/xtext-languageserver-example/tree/master/vscode-extension-self-contained) and modified for the usage of Fat JAR language server. 

For creating new VS Code Extension out of your language server, change the language-specific parts, marked with TODO comment.
